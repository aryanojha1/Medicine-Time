**Medicine Time**
---
Medicine Time is an Android native programme designed to help the forgetful and busy recall to take their daily medicines. It is intended for users who need a little assistance keeping track of their medication routine but are committed to sticking to it. The software enables the user to save pill objects as well as numerous alerts for those medications. Alarms have a specific time of day and can appear on different days of the week. The user can view their medications in today's view and pick a date to examine drugs. Furthermore, the application saves a history of when each medicine was consumed, which will help the user keep track of their medication usage.
